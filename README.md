Challenge Accepted - Project Complete

Known issues:

1. Please run on simulator because it currently runs slow on a device.  Needs image downloading/caching optimizations.
2. Landscape not supported yet.
3. Links embedded in blog post are not active.

Suggested enhancements:

1. Make images look like a picture by adding a white frame.
2. Add a Header to each blog using the slug as the caption.
3. Have the blog embedded links push a nav controller web view in order to view the original blog.
4. Have the image placeholders show random text, i.e., "Cool Place", "Awesome People", etc.
